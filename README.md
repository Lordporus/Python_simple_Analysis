Weather Conditions Analysis

•	Unleash the Power of Data Insights!

	Welcome to the Weather Conditions Analysis 
project, where we dive into the world of weather data to uncover hidden patterns and trends!


•	Project Overview


	This project aims to analyze and visualize weather data to gain a deeper understanding of weather conditions and their impact on our daily lives. Using the power of Python and data science techniques, we'll explore the characteristics of different weather conditions, identify patterns, and create interactive visualizations to communicate our findings.


•	Project Features


	Explore the mean values of each column against each weather condition Analyze and visualize weather data to identify patterns and trends Use interactive visualizations to communicate insights and findings Leverage Python and data science techniques to gain a deeper understanding of weather conditions.

•	Code


	The code is written in Python and uses the Pandas library to manipulate the data. The script is divided into several steps:



1.	Import the necessary libraries
2.	Load the data from the CSV file
3.	Select only the numeric columns
4.	Group the data by the 'Weather Condition' 	column.
5.	Calculate the mean of each column for each 	group
6.	Print the result.


•	Troubleshooting


	If you encounter any errors while running the 	code, check the following:
•	Make sure the data.csv file is in the same 	directory as the Python script
•	Check that the 'Weather Condition' column 	exists in the data
•	Verify that the data is in a correct format 	(i.e., the columns are separated by commas)
